  Main challenges
  *************** 

    1st. Getting your resume to Employers 
      - Getting connected with recruiters and employers 

    2nd. When it comes to applying directly, your number one challenge by far is to be able to pass the first filters (ATSs and HR) and get an interview 

    3rd. Your third challenge is passing the interview 

    4th. Staying motivated during this lengthy and stressful period 
  
  The strategies you need to follow
  ********************************** 

    Creating connections with recruiters
    ************************************ 
      - As we have mentioned above, the best thing you can do to increase your chance of getting an interview is to increase your social circle of potential connections with employers. 
        - LinkedeIn 
        - Your friends and families 
        - Job fairs  

    Passing ATSs
    ************ 
      - A well written resume plays the key part in here 
        - The way to beat the ATSs is to include as much KEY words as possible on your resume 
      - Will send you a sample resume to get you started with for this

    Getting picked by HR 
    ********************  
      - A clean, well organized and designed portfolio website plays the biggest role in here 
        - The design and proper grammar is what matters the most in here 

      - A well written and properly formatted resume plays a huge role in here too 
        - Use https://www.kickresume.com/en/ 
         
    Getting your resume to the Employers 
    ************************************
      - The number of applications you submit every day is the prerequisite for the success of any of the strategies mentioned above  
        - Prepare to apply 10+ a day right after you finish your projects  

      - Recruiters play a huge part in here too 
        *** - This is where LinkedIn and Networking comes to play 

    Getting picked by the technical people 
    **************************************  
      - This is where the projects you did play a huge role 
        - Apple, Netflix, Amazon, side projects, etc ... 

    Crashing the final technical interview 
    *************************************** 
      - There is no way around this. You just have to study and know the answers for every possible interview question you might be asked. 

      - Getting here and failing is really really frustrating 
        *** Prepare well for your interview **** 

        One sample page to get your interview questions from 
          https://github.com/aershov24/full-stack-interview-questions
          
    Reference 
    ********** 
      - You will definitely be asked for a reference if you are applying for any position that is not a junior
      
      - Forming your own company as a group is the best recommendation I have for you. 

    Staying motivated
    ***************** 
      - That is why we invested the last four month creating the group 

      - This is the time you all are going to support each other and work together in the ups and downs you all are going to face 

  What we have learned from the previous batch 
  ********************************************* 

    - The positive
      - They stayed together as a group and kept meeting and studying 
        - Sept batch are studying PHP 
        - Aug batch are even studying machine learning 
        - Dec batch are also studying the interview questions together 

    - The negative 
      - They are not constantly applying 
        - Some are even going back and retaking the course when they are actually better off learning something else and focusing on the job search specifically 

    - We need to change the negative and keep the positive  

  The next three weeks
